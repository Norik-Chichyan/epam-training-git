Andrea Bocelli - Love in Portofino

I found my love in portofino
I found my love in Portofino
Down in a small Italian Bay
after my daily capuccino
In Portofino, love came my way
 
She was right there, It was September
I felt the fire in her eyes
that was a moment I'll remember
I fell in love in paradise
 
There was a place made just for lovers
across the street, a friendly bar
a piano man I loved and others
were singing playing a guitar
 
Please join me for a drink, I asked her
as she walked along the sand,
"you're good," she said, in Portofino
she looked at me and took my hand
 
There was a place made just for lovers
across the street, a friendly bar
a piano man I loved and others
were singing playing a guitar
 
My life changed the day I met her
and since then, when we look above
she'll whisper softly Portofino
in Portofino, we found our love
